Used Kruskal Algorithm for minimun spanning tree
Taken an undirected, connected and weigthed graph, find minimun spanning tree (MST) of the graph using Krushal's algorithm.
steps for finding MST are-
1. Sort all the edges in non-decreasing order of their weight.
2. Pick the smallest edge. check if it forms a cycle with the spanning tree formed so far. If cycle is not formed, inculde this edge.
3. Repeat step2 until there are (V-1) edges in the spanning tree.
